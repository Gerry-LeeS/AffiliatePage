## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Search System:**  
   A JavaScript-powered search bar filters casinos in real-time based on user input.

2. **Data Source:**  
   The data file contains an array of casino entries with their display names and corresponding URLs.  
   Clicking a result takes the user directly to the appropriate review page.

3. **Scalability:**  
   New reviews can be added easily by including additional entries in the data file and uploading a corresponding review page.

4. **Deployment:**  
   The site is deployed via a static hosting platform with automatic builds triggered by Git commits.
