    <h2 class="headingtext">Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>Last updated: 01/11/2025</p>
    <p class="privacy-overview padding-bottom">
    Welcome to Casino Site Reviews (“we”, “us”, or “our”). By using this website (the “Site”), you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully before using our services. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please refrain from using the site.

    </p>

    <div class="privacy-flex">
        <p>1. About Us</p>
        <p class="padding-bottom">
        Casino Site Reviews is an independent affiliate marketing website that provides reviews, comparisons, and promotional content relating to licensed online casinos and bookmakers operating legally in the United Kingdom.

        We do not provide gambling services or process bets. We act solely as an information and referral platform.
        </p>

        <p>2. Eligibility</p>
        <p class="padding-bottom">
        This website is intended for UK residents aged 18 years or older. By using this Site, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age and that online gambling is legal in your jurisdiction.

        Engaging with gambling content or operators featured on this site while under the age of 18 is a criminal offence.
        </p>
        <p>3. Licensing and Responsible Gambling</p>
        <p class="padding-bottom">
        All operators we promote are licensed and regulated by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC).

        We support responsible gambling and encourage all users to bet safely and within their limits. If you feel you may have a gambling problem, please visit:

        <ul>
            <li><a target="blank" href="https://begambleaware.org">BeGambleAware.org</a></li>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>4. Affiliate Disclosure</p>
        <p class="padding-bottom">
        Casino Site Reviews participates in affiliate marketing programmes. This means we may earn a commission when you click on links to third-party gambling operators and subsequently register or deposit funds.

        Our reviews and recommendations are independent and unbiased, but users should be aware that these affiliate relationships may influence placement or promotional content.
        </p>
        <p>5. Accuracy of Information</p>
        <p class="padding-bottom">
            We strive to ensure that all information presented on the Site — including operator reviews, bonus offers, and licensing details — is accurate and up to date. However, we cannot guarantee that all content is error-free or current at all times.

            It is your responsibility to verify the terms and conditions of any gambling site before registering or accepting a promotional offer.
        </p>
        <p>6. No Wagering or Financial Transactions</p>
        <p class="padding-bottom">
            We do not offer or facilitate real-money gambling. All deposits, wagers, and withdrawals are processed directly through the third-party operators we link to.

            We accept no responsibility for any losses, disputes, or issues arising from your use of any third-party gambling platform.
        </p>
        <p>7. Intellectual Property</p>
